# Asphalt-Machine
The files seen above have been developed by me (Gilberto Gonzalez) and David Perez for FIU'S Autonomous vehicle for asphalt laying that uses computer vision to detect potholes and avoid objects. 

Pre-requisites to utlizing the files above are:

ROS Kinetic

common_msgs (acquire from source)  // this ensures you have all message type dependencies

realsense-ros (acquire from source)  // driver for the Intel RealSense Depth Camera

roboclaw (acquire from source)  // driver for the roboclaw motor controller
